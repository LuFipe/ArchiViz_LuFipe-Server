# ArchiViz-WebServer
 Creating a WebServer for my site Curriculo/PortFolio-ArchiViz using Express and Express Generator App
Due to some inexperience, I've restarted this project basically from scratch. Still using express an express-generator, but this time I'm modifying the directory tree so it attend to my needs.
Also using pug properly this time in order to reduce javascript from staticaly interacting with the main page.
In the future, I must add pages and database (sqlite3) to upload files without the need to alter the source code.
